Python program to find the longest common prefix among a set of strings such as ["flower", "flow", "flight"]:  

def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Sort the strings to minimize comparisons
    strs.sort()
    
    # Compare the first and last strings (smallest and largest lexicographically)
    first = strs[0]
    last = strs[-1]
    common_prefix = ""
    
    for i in range(min(len(first), len(last))):
        if first[i] == last[i]:
            common_prefix += first[i]
        else:
            break
    
    return common_prefix

# Input array of strings
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

# Find the longest common prefix
result = longest_common_prefix(strings)
print("Longest Common Prefix:", result)


Explanation:
1. Sort the array lexicographically so the first and last strings are the most different.
2. Compare characters of the first and last strings until a mismatch occurs.
3. Return the accumulated prefix.

Output:

Longest Common Prefix: fl
